         <p>In the "Laws of Sanctification of the Moon", Rambam gives algorithmic description of two
                calendars: fixed ("arithmetic") and observational ("astronomical"). Both calendars are described in a form ready
                to be implemented, but the reasons for the calculation steps - especially for the astronomical calendar - are not
                always given: what are the models - and the formulae resulting from them - that reproduce the numbers?
                Sometimes Rambam describes the models, so only the formulae need to be reconstructed; sometimes the models are not
                described, so both the models and the formulae need to be reconstructed.

                  <p>In 1984, The Rebbe instructed Jews to learn Rambam every day. As a result, in 1991 I encountered calendar
                               chapters of Rambam, decided to reconstruct the models behind the calculations described in them, and discovered
                               mistakes in the text of one of the laws (15:6). The results were published in "Notices of Temimim and Anash", a
                               weekly of the central Lubavicher Yeshiva 770. Some of the readers were appalled that someone dares to correct the
                               text of Rambam! My point was that the text as published contains mistakes that need to be corrected. Indeed,
                               Frenkel edition [<a class="biblioref" href="bibliography.html#Frenkel">Frenkel</a>], that was already published at the time, corrects all of the
                               mistakes I did. In fact, they were already corrected by Hazon Ish in his commentary on Rambam [[<a href="bibliography.html#HazonIsh" class="biblioref">HazonIsh</a>]] - but I did not know it then.
