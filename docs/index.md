There are a few ongoing projects:
- digital edition of Rabbi Wichnin's [Chumash Questions](https://www.chumashquestions.org/) book;
- [archive documents](https://www.alter-rebbe.org) from the early history of Chabad
 (including the arrests of the Alter Rebbe in 1798 and 1800);
- code that [generates](https://github.com/opentorah/opentorah/tree/master/collector) the above website;   
- paper ([HTML](/texts/paper/dream/html/index.html), [PDF](/texts/paper/dream/pdf/dream.pdf),
  [EPUB](/texts/paper/dream/epub2/dream.epub)) describing ideas (dating from 1991) for the dream environment for
   working with Jewish texts;
- companion paper ([HTML](/texts/paper/typesetting/html/index.html), [PDF](/texts/paper/typesetting/pdf/typesetting.pdf),
  [EPUB](/texts/paper/typesetting/epub2/typesetting.epub)) on typesetting Jewish texts;
- [code](https://github.com/opentorah/opentorah/tree/master/site) implementing some of those ideas and
  [code](https://github.com/opentorah/opentorah/tree/master/texts) for working with specific Jewish texts;
- paper ([HTML](/calendar/paper/html/index.html), [PDF](/calendar/paper/pdf/calendar.pdf),
  [EPUB](/calendar/paper/epub2/calendar.epub)) on Rambam's Laws of the Sanctification of the Moon;
  goals of the paper:
  - reconstruct models that Rambam uses and their parameters from the Rambam's text;
  - identify misprints in the traditional editions; 
  - see how Rambam's calculations of the moon visibility compare to the current models;
- [code](https://github.com/opentorah/opentorah/tree/master/calendar) implementing Rambam's calculations
  with dates, time intervals and angles and related algorithms;   
- [code](https://github.com/opentorah/opentorah/tree/master/schedule) for calculating Torah reading/learning schedules;
- [code](https://github.com/opentorah/opentorah/tree/master/base) used by other modules for
  processing metadata, XML, TEI and general utilities;   
- desire to publishing this paper in multiple formats was part of the motivation for writing
  [Gradle DocBook plugin](https://github.com/opentorah/opentorah/tree/master/docbook) in general
  and its support for mathematics in DocBook in particular;
