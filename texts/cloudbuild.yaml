# gradle: prepare docker context
# Latest Gradle builder on Google Cloud Build

# is obsolete; for a while I used custom builder that I had to build myself for each Gradle update:
#  - name: 'gcr.io/calendar-service-1/gradle:5.1.1-jdk-8'
# https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders/pull/452
# was supposed to make official Gradle images available on GCB; it is now August 2019, and - nothing.
# gavingolden explained how to run Gradle version set in the wrapper (although Gradle distribution gets downloaded every time):
# https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders/pull/452#issuecomment-485148016.
# That's what I do now.
